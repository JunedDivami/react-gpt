- Hey, I want you to act as my React assistant, I aim to develop a clean, optimized, and efficient React application, so let's start guiding me with how to create a React application, I want you to be specific

1. Task 1: Building an AXIOS Wrapper

- Create a TypeScript module for an AXIOS wrapper to streamline HTTP requests in your application. Begin by setting up necessary configurations such as the base URL and headers. Implement a function to automatically add security tokens to requests before they are sent. Ensure consistent data handling by implementing functions to process data returned from API calls. Additionally, include a function to handle file uploads, ensuring files are sent correctly with the request. Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage HTTP errors effectively. Finally, implement a function to handle file downloads, accommodating changes in header values for different file types.- 

2. Task 2: Building a Reusable Autocomplete Component

- Design a reusable Autocomplete component in TypeScript. Define the component structure and implement logic to fetch data from the server or locally based on configuration settings. Incorporate debounce functionality to reduce unnecessary API calls, improving performance. Ensure the component is flexible and can be easily integrated into different parts of your application.

3. Task 3: Building a Reusable Form Component

- Develop a reusable Form component in TypeScript with a modular structure. Decide how each field type (text input, textarea, checkbox, radio button, select dropdown) will be represented within the component. Implement each field type, ensuring consistency in design and functionality. Make sure the component is flexible enough to accommodate various form requirements across your application.

4. Task 4: Building Utility Functions for Field Validations

- Create TypeScript utility functions for field validations. Implement a function to validate email fields, ensuring they adhere to the correct format. Additionally, develop a function to validate password fields according to specified criteria. These utility functions should be reusable and easily integrated into form components or other parts of your application where field validation is necessary.-
